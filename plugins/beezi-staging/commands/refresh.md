description: Refresh this machine's Claude subscription/plan for Beezi analytics
allowed-tools: Bash(node:*)
---

Run EXACTLY this one command — do not modify it, do not substitute your own, and
do not read or inspect any files yourself:

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/billing-capture.mjs --from-claude --via refresh`

The script asks Claude Code itself for the non-secret subscription info
(`claude auth status`) and reads the non-secret account metadata from
`~/.claude.json` (never any token, never the credentials file), then stores the
plan. Report its one-line output verbatim. If it says nothing was captured, tell the user their Claude subscription
info was not found. If the output says the self-reported plan was kept, report
that verbatim to the user. If the output contains `gateway=custom`, tell the user
this machine goes through a custom API endpoint, so only they can say what it
bills — point them at `/beezi:login`, which asks.
