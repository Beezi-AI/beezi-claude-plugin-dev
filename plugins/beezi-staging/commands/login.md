Do NOT read, open, or inspect any files yourself. Run only the given commands.

Step 1 — sign in (opens the browser; blocks until the sign-in completes):

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/login.mjs`

The command opens the user's browser to Beezi's sign-in page and finishes by
itself once they approve there. Show the user the command's output. If it says
the machine is **already linked**, tell the user — then still continue with
Step 2 below, so a user whose subscription tier changed can still refresh it.
Never echo any token or credential.

Step 2 — capture the subscription plan for analytics (run this after a
successful Step 1 link, OR when Step 1 reported the machine was already
linked). Run EXACTLY this one command, unmodified:

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/billing-capture.mjs --from-claude --via login`

It reads only the non-secret account info from `~/.claude.json`. Report its
one-line summary. If it could not resolve the plan, continue to Step 3.

Step 3 — ask the user their tier (ONLY when Step 2 printed
`no Claude subscription info found`, `plan=unknown`, or
`keeping the self-reported plan`; skip this step entirely when Step 2 printed
a known plan, or when its output shows `source=anthropic_api_key` or
`source=third_party` — those machines do not bill a subscription, so a tier
question does not apply).

Ask with the AskUserQuestion tool: "How does this machine pay for Claude?"
with exactly these options: "Pro", "Max 5x", "Max 20x", "Team or Enterprise",
"I use an API key (no subscription)". If they pick "Team or Enterprise", ask one
follow-up question with options "Team" and "Enterprise".

The API-key option matters: without it a machine paying per-token gets pinned to
a subscription tier, and its spend and errors are then reported under that plan.

Map the final answer through this table — no other values are valid:

| Answer                | value        |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
| Pro                   | `pro`        |
| Max 5x                | `max_5x`     |
| Max 20x               | `max_20x`    |
| Team                  | `team`       |
| Enterprise            | `enterprise` |
| I use an API key      | `api_key`    |

Then run EXACTLY this command, substituting only `<value>`:

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/billing-capture.mjs --plan <value> --via login-user`

Report its one-line summary. If the user dismisses the question or answers
something not in the table, skip the capture — the link itself already
succeeded, say so.

Step 4 — upload past sessions (ALWAYS run this last, after Steps 2/3, on both
fresh links and already-linked machines). Run EXACTLY this one command:

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/backfill.mjs --via login`

It is the one-time upload of this machine's Claude Code history into Beezi and
can take several minutes; it prints progress lines as it goes. Report its
output verbatim — progress and final summary, or the error line. It is safe on
every login: already-uploaded sessions are skipped, and if it says nothing new
to upload, just tell the user their history is up to date. If some sessions
could not be delivered, tell the user that re-running /beezi:login later will
resume the upload where it left off. Never echo any token.

If it reports the one-time import **has already been used**, that is final —
the import is once per account and cannot be re-run. Do NOT retry, do NOT run
the script again with different flags, and refuse politely if the user asks
you to bypass it; relay the script's message (including the upgrade suggestion
when it prints one) and stop.

Note for the user, only when Step 4 reports the pull finalized: the pull is
one-time per account and tool — if they have Claude Code history on other
machines, they should run /beezi:login there BEFORE it finalizes; a finalized
pull cannot be re-opened.
