// The THIRD home of CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN, and the only one this process cannot simply read:
// the OS-level persistent environment (Windows' User/Machine registry env, macOS' launchctl).
//
// WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS AT ALL. Verified against the shipped Claude Code bundle 2.1.251: its
// child-environment builder explicitly does `delete d.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` — alongside
// CLAUDE_CODE_ARTIFACTS_API_TOKEN and CLAUDE_CODE_SLACK_TAG_TOKEN — for EVERY subprocess it spawns:
// hooks, stdio MCP servers, the Bash tool, LSP servers, plugin commands, `gh`. It is plain JS with
// no platform branch, so macOS behaves exactly like Windows, and the scrub is self-triggering: the
// sanitize branch engages precisely BECAUSE the token is present. Consequence: a plugin hook can
// never see CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN in process.env, no matter how the user set it. That — not the
// `setx`-after-Claude-Code-started ordering story this module's predecessor told — is the primary
// cause of every "I set a setup token and Beezi says there is none" report.
//
// Also verified: a `settings.json` `env` entry lands in Claude Code's OWN process.env and is then
// scrubbed on the way out again, which is why lib/claude-settings-env.mjs has to READ the settings
// file rather than trust inheritance. This module is the same move one layer down.
//
// THIS STEPS OVER A FENCE ANTHROPIC PUT UP ON PURPOSE. They scrub the variable so a setup token
// does not spread into arbitrary child processes, and reading it back out of the registry defeats
// that for this one process. It is done knowingly, for one narrow purpose (naming the subscription
// behind the key a human just asked about), and the discipline that makes it defensible is kept
// absolutely: the raw value NEVER leaves this process. Only the existing prefix/last4/length
// fingerprint is ever persisted or sent — see oauth-identity.mjs. It is also never put in argv:
// only the variable NAME crosses a command line, because process listings are world-readable.
//
// NOT PROOF OF WHAT CLAUDE CODE AUTHENTICATED WITH. A registry value may have been rotated after
// the session started, so a recovered token describes the machine's configuration, not the
// session's credential. No branch guards that, and none can — the fingerprint is the only local
// signal that moves when the token does (see oauth-identity.mjs), and a stale fingerprint is still
// a better answer than the "no key at all" the scrub would otherwise produce.
//
// THIS RUNS ON HOOK PATHS, so the budget is the design constraint. It reaches the PostToolUse-Bash
// checkpoint (lib/checkpoint.mjs) and SessionStart, where the whole hook has 10s and the identity
// stamp is the reason the token has to get here at all. Measured on Windows 11 (26200):
//
//   no token set (the common case)  2 reg queries, ~56ms total (31ms HKCU + 25ms HKLM), no PowerShell
//   token in User scope             1 reg query, 38ms median (34.8-46.0, n=8, fresh process each)
//   reg.exe unusable                + ~261ms for the PowerShell fallback — the rare path only
//   linux / other                   0 spawns
//   darwin                          1 launchctl call, ~10ms
//
// Keeping the no-token case off PowerShell is the whole point of the stderr capture in defaultRun;
// before it, every Bash tool call on a token-less Windows machine paid the full ~316ms to learn
// nothing. On top of that the module-level cache below makes this ONE probe per process, so a hook
// pays it at most once no matter how many callers ask.
//
// CALLER CONTRACT, and it is load-bearing for that cache: PRODUCTION CALLERS PASS NO DEPS. Call it
// as `osEnvOauthToken()`. Injecting anything — `env`, `platform` or `run` — bypasses the cache by
// design, because an injected deps object describes a different machine. `deps.env` in particular
// is only the map that %VAR% references expand against, and it already defaults to process.env, so
// there is never a reason to forward a caller's env into it; doing so would quietly turn "one probe
// per hook process" back into two reg queries per call. Only tests inject.
