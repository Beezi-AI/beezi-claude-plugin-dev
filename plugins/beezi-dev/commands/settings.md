Do NOT read, open, or inspect any files. Never echo any token.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

The user cannot see tool output: Claude Code collapses it after a few lines. A script's output
reaches the user only through your reply text or a question's `preview`, so output you are told
to show is copied VERBATIM into your reply, as its very first text: exactly as printed, never
summarized, paraphrased, reformatted or replaced by a sentence of your own ("I've noted…" is
wrong). Machine lines (`key=value` lines, and every line of an output you are told not to show)
are never shown.

Previews: whenever a single-select question below says "with previews", give EVERY option a
`preview` holding the named script output, copied exactly (a markdown table stays a table). The
preview is what the user reads while choosing, so never leave it out.

AskUserQuestion, everywhere below: at most 4 questions in one call and at most 4 options in one
question; `multiSelect: true` only with 2 or more options. Make one AskUserQuestion call per
message and wait for its answers before the next (two calls in one message show the user only
the last). A dismissed question runs nothing.

## Show

Only when the arguments are empty (or name no section below), run EXACTLY:

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/settings.mjs`

and write its output verbatim as your reply text, before anything else. With a section or `show`
in the arguments, skip it: that section prints its own current settings. Always run EXACTLY (its
output is for you only; do not show it):

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/settings.mjs keys`

It prints:

- `menu=<label>|<label>…` — the sections that apply here;
- one line per linked account: `account=<key> default=<yes|no> multi=<yes|no> status=<…> email=<email>`
  (`multi=yes`: the account is in several workspaces; no such line: nothing is linked);
- `crash=<correlate|on|anonymous|off> statusline=<on|off>`.

## Route

First, `show` prints the current settings and changes nothing:

- `show` alone → run EXACTLY `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/settings.mjs all`, write its output
  verbatim as your reply text, and stop.
- A section followed by `show` (`rules show`, `new-folders show`, `account show`, `telemetry show`
  or `statusline show`) → run EXACTLY `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/settings.mjs <section>`,
  where `<section>` is `rules`, `new-folders`, `account` or `privacy` (for `telemetry`/`statusline`),
  write its output verbatim as your reply text, and stop.

Otherwise, by the first word of the arguments:

- `rules` → Rules, with the rest of the arguments.
- `new-folders` → New folders.
- `account` → Account.
- `refresh` → Account → Refresh my Claude plan.
- `telemetry` or `statusline` → Crash reports & status line, with the rest of the arguments.
- Nothing, or anything else → first run EXACTLY (for previews only; do not write it out):
  `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/settings.mjs all` — it prints one block per section, each
  starting with a `## <section>` heading. Then ask (single-select, with previews: each option's
  `preview` = the lines of its own `## <label>` block, after the heading and up to the next `## `
  heading) "What do you want to change?" with one option
  per `menu=` label, in its order and with exactly its text. Descriptions: Rules — "Where each
  repo or folder sends its analytics"; New folders — "Where analytics go for a repo or folder
  with no rule"; Account — "Refresh your Claude plan" (plus "or pick the default account" when
  there are several `account=` lines); Crash reports & status line — "Plugin crash reports and
  Beezi's status line". Go to the chosen section. A dismissal stops here.

## Choosing the account (Rules and New folders)

Use the `account=` lines with `multi=yes`.

- No `account=` line at all → say this machine is not linked and to run /beezi:login; stop.
- None with `multi=yes` → say this setting applies only to an account in several workspaces, and stop.
- Exactly one → use it.
- Several → ask (single-select) "Whose rules?" (Rules) or "Whose New folders setting?" (New
  folders), one option per such line: label = its `email=`, at most 4 options (the "Other" answer
  takes a typed email).

`<key>` below is the chosen line's `account=` value.

## The workspace question

The same question Beezi asks at a session start, about one repo, folder, or the sessions outside a
project folder. Its line's `kind=` picks the text (`<short>` is the name the line gives, `<label>`
the text in parentheses right after it):

| `kind=`   | Question                                                                        | Last option               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `repo`    | "Where should analytics for <short> go?"                                        | "Don't track this repo"   |
| `folder`  | "Where should analytics for <label> (and everything inside it) go?"             | "Don't track this folder" |
| `outside` | "Where should analytics for sessions outside a project folder go?"              | "Don't track these"       |

`multiSelect: true`. Options: one per `W.` line — label = the workspace name (the text after
`W. ` up to ` account=`), description = the line's `role=` value, or "Beezi workspace" when it is
empty — then the last option, description "Nothing from <short> is uploaded" ("Nothing from
sessions outside a project folder is uploaded" for `outside`). When it
changes an existing rule, add ", current" to the descriptions of the workspaces in that rule's
`tenants=` (or of the last option when `tenants=none`).

More than 4 options → split them evenly into questions of at most 4 (5 → 3 + 2), the last option
in the last question, each question's text ending in " (part j of k)"; the answer is all of them
together.

`<ids>` = the chosen workspaces' `tenant=` values joined by commas (e.g. `t1,t2`), or `none` when
the last option is chosen (it wins over the others). Nothing chosen → run nothing.

## Rules

Choose the account, then run EXACTLY and write its output verbatim as your reply text:

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/workspace.mjs rules --table --account <key>`

Then run EXACTLY (for you only; do not show it):

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/workspace.mjs rules --account <key>`

Its lines:

- `W. <workspace> account=<key> tenant=<id> role=<role>` — one per workspace;
- `R<n>. <short> (<label>) → <workspaces | not tracked> account=<key> rule=<n> kind=<…> tenants=<ids|none> match=<…>`
  — one per rule;
- `here: <short> (<label>) → <R<n> | no rule> account=<key> rule=<n|none> kind=<…> match=<…>` — this
  folder, and the rule it follows now.

A `kind=outside` line has no ` (<label>)`. `<here>` = the `here:` line's `<short>`, or "sessions
outside a project" when its `kind=outside`. The `here:` line's rule is "its own" when that `R<n>.`
line has the same `kind=` and `match=` as the `here:` line; otherwise it is a wider rule (a parent
folder) that covers this repo or folder.

Then by the rest of the arguments:

- `add` → Add.
- `remove <n>` → Remove, with rule `<n>` (drop a leading `R`).
- `remove` → Remove.
- Anything else, or nothing → ask (single-select, with previews: the `rules --table` output) "What do you want to do with rules?", offering
  only the options that apply, in this order:
  - "Add a rule for <here>" — the `here:` line has `rule=none`;
  - "Change where <here> goes" ("go" for `outside`) — the `here:` line names its own rule;
    description = that rule's `R<n>.` line up to ` account=`;
  - "Change where <rule short> goes (covers <here>)" — the `here:` line names a wider rule;
    `<rule short>` = that `R<n>.` line's `<short>`, description = that line up to ` account=`;
  - "Add a rule just for <here>" — the `here:` line names a wider rule; description "Only <here>
    changes; R<n> keeps the rest";
  - "Change a rule" — there is an `R<n>.` line;
  - "Remove a rule" — there is an `R<n>.` line;
  - "Done" — only when fewer than 4 options come before it (otherwise a dismissal is the way out).

  "Done" or a dismissal stops.

Add, or "Add a rule just for <here>" — ask the workspace question about the `here:` line, then run
EXACTLY:

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/workspace.mjs rule add --current <ids> --account <key>`

"Change where … goes" (either form) — ask the workspace question about the `R<n>.` line the `here:`
line names, then run EXACTLY, with its `rule=` value:

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/workspace.mjs rule set <n> <ids> --account <key>`

Change a rule — pick a rule ("Which rule do you want to change?"), ask the workspace question
about its `R<n>.` line, then run the `rule set` command above with its number.

Remove — with no `R<n>.` line, say the account has no rules and stop. With a number from the
arguments: when no `R<n>.` line has it, say there is no rule R<n> and stop; otherwise ask
(single-select) "Remove R<n> (<short>)?" (`<short>` from that line) with the options "Yes"
(description "Delete the rule; new sessions there follow New folders") and "No" ("Keep it"), and
only "Yes" goes on. Without a number, pick a rule ("Which rule do you want to remove?"). Run
EXACTLY:

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/workspace.mjs rule remove <n> --account <key>`

Picking a rule — single-select, one option per `R<n>.` line, the first 4: label = "R<n>. <short>",
description = the text after `→ ` up to ` account=`. With only one `R<n>.` line, add the option
"Cancel" (description "Change nothing"). With more than 4, end the question with " Type another
rule's number under Other."; the "Other" answer is the number (drop a leading `R`). "Cancel" or a
dismissal runs nothing.

After `rule add`, `rule set` or `rule remove`, write its first line verbatim (an error line too).

## New folders

First run EXACTLY and write its output verbatim as your reply text (the current setting, before
anything else):

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/settings.mjs new-folders`

Choose the account, then run EXACTLY (for you only; do not show it):

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/workspace.mjs new-folders --account <key>`

Its lines: a first summary line, `W.` lines as in Rules, and last
`new-folders=<ask|send|none> set=<yes|no> multi=yes account=<key>`.

Ask (single-select, with previews: the `settings.mjs new-folders` output) "For a repo or folder with no rule, where should analytics go?" with the
options "Ask me" (description "Beezi asks once per repo or folder, when a session starts there"),
"Send to…" ("Pick the workspaces that get them") and "Don't send" ("Nothing from a repo or folder
with no rule is uploaded"); add " (current)" to the description of the option matching
`new-folders=` (`ask`, `send`, `none`).

- "Ask me" → run EXACTLY `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/workspace.mjs new-folders ask --account <key>`
- "Don't send" → run EXACTLY `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/workspace.mjs new-folders none --account <key>`
- "Send to…" → ask (`multiSelect: true`) "Which workspaces should get analytics for repos and
  folders with no rule?", one option per `W.` line (label and description as in the workspace
  question); more than 4 → split evenly into questions of at most 4 (5 → 3 + 2), each ending in
  " (j of k)". Nothing chosen → run nothing. Otherwise run EXACTLY, with the chosen `tenant=`
  values joined by commas:

  `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/workspace.mjs new-folders send <ids> --account <key>`

Write the command's first line verbatim (an error line too).

## Account

First run EXACTLY and write its output verbatim as your reply text (the current account settings,
before anything else):

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/settings.mjs account`

Then:

- No `account=` line → say this machine is not linked and to run /beezi:login; stop.
- One `account=` line → go straight to Refresh my Claude plan.
- Several → ask (single-select, with previews: the `settings.mjs account` output) "What do you want to do?" with the options "Refresh my Claude
  plan" (description "Re-read which Claude subscription this machine bills") and "Default account"
  ("Pick which account /beezi:analytics reads from"). A dismissal stops.

### Default account

Selectable accounts are the `account=` lines whose `status=` is not `revoked`.

- None → say every linked account's authorization was revoked and to run /beezi:login; stop.
- Exactly one → use it without asking.
- Several → ask (single-select) "Which account should /beezi:analytics read from?", one option per
  selectable line: label = its `email=`, description "current default" when `default=yes`, else
  "Linked account"; at most 4 options (the "Other" answer takes a typed email).

Run EXACTLY, with the chosen line's `account=` value:

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/accounts.mjs use <key>`

and write its output verbatim. (Session tracking goes to every linked account whatever the default;
/beezi:logout removes an account.)

### Refresh my Claude plan

Two steps, in this order. Step 1 always runs and decides the rest: on a machine
signing in with a Claude setup token it is the whole command, and Step 2 must not
run. Step 2 runs only for the machines Step 1 explicitly sends there.

#### Step 1 — ask the server about the setup token, if there is one

A machine signing in with `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` cannot prove its plan
locally: Claude Code writes no account metadata under that auth mode, so anything
a local capture finds on such a machine is a previous login's leftovers. Only the
server knows whether that key has been given a subscription — which is why this
question is asked FIRST, before anything local is read or reported. Presenting a
leftover plan as this machine's plan and only then discovering it cannot be
trusted is the exact mistake this ordering exists to prevent.

Run:

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/key-resolve.mjs status`

It prints exactly one JSON object. Read `status` from it and do exactly this:

| `status`                          | What to do                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"resolved"`                      | Say the key's subscription is known, naming `subscriptionPlan`, and that it is now what Beezi reports for this machine. **Then, only if `accountAnchored` is `true` AND `planSource` is `"reported"`**, add that this plan comes from a subscription an earlier sign-in established rather than one confirmed for this key — name `accountEmail` when it is not null — and that re-pointing it is an admin's job, not something this command can do. **Stop — do not run Step 2.** |
| `"unknown_key"`                   | The server does not know this key yet (the command registers it when the read workspace is one this session sends to). Say Beezi could not register this key with the server yet and to try `/beezi:settings refresh` again later. **Stop — do not run Step 2.** |
| `"unlinked"`                      | Continue to Step 1a — this is the case worth asking about.                                   |
| `"unavailable"`                   | Report the object's `message` verbatim. **Stop — do not run Step 2.**                        |
| `"no_key"`                        | Say NOTHING about this step — do not print the object's `message`, do not mention setup tokens, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or this check at all. This machine is not on a setup token, so the question did not apply to it and the local capture is its real answer. Go straight to Step 2; its one line is the whole output the user sees. |
| `"not_linked"`                    | Report the object's `message` verbatim, then continue to Step 2. |
| `"auth_unavailable"`              | Report the object's `message` verbatim. This machine IS linked — the saved login just could not be read this moment (a busy OS credential store, a renewal in flight). Never suggest `/beezi:login`: there is nothing wrong with the link and signing in again fixes nothing. **Stop — do not run Step 2.** |
| `null` (a JSON null, not a string) | The server answered something this plugin does not understand, so the key's subscription cannot be resolved right now. Say exactly that and suggest trying again later. **Stop — do not run Step 2.** |

Whichever row you land on, never state a subscription plan that did not come out
of this JSON object.

##### 1a — how do they want to resolve it

Ask with the AskUserQuestion tool: "Beezi does not know which subscription this
machine's Claude setup token bills. How do you want to resolve it?"

Build the options from the JSON you just read — do not invent them:

- "Use one of my subscriptions" — include this option **only if**
  `subscriptions` is a non-empty array.
- "Name the plan" — always include.
- "Enter an email or account id" — always include.

##### 1b — the follow-up, by what they picked

**Picked "Use one of my subscriptions".** Ask a second question, "Which
subscription does this machine bill?", with one option per entry in
`subscriptions`, using that entry's `label` as the option label (the list rule
below). Then run, with the chosen entry's `target` substituted verbatim:

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/key-resolve.mjs --target <target>`

**Picked "Name the plan".** Ask a second question, "Which plan is this
subscription on?", with one option per entry in `selectablePlans`, using that
entry's `label` as the option label (the list rule below). Then run, with the
chosen entry's `plan` value (not its label) substituted verbatim:

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/key-resolve.mjs --plan <plan>`

The list rule: only the first 4 entries become options. With more than 4, end the question
with " Type another one's name under Other."; the "Other" answer is the entry whose `label`
matches it (ignoring case), and one that matches none is an answer that is not one of the
options.

**Picked "Enter an email or account id".** Do not ask a multiple-choice question
— wait for the user to type the value in their next message, then run:

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/key-resolve.mjs --target <value>`

##### 1c — report the result

Run the resolve command EXACTLY ONCE, then print its one line verbatim. The two
link outcomes are different events and the wording already distinguishes them —
joining an existing subscription is not the same as the key standing on its own,
so do not paraphrase them into one sentence.

If the user dismisses a question, or answers something that is not one of the
options you offered, skip the resolve command entirely and say the key was left
unresolved, so this machine’s usage is still reported without a plan. Do not fall
back to Step 2 to fill the gap — a local capture on a setup-token machine reads a
previous login’s leftovers, which is what left the plan wrong in the first place.

A resolve command that succeeds records what the server named, so the next session
report carries it. `--plan` always names a plan. `--target` names one only when the
server reports the joined subscription's plan; when it does not, the next session
start fills it in from the resolution. Either way nothing else needs running.

#### Step 2 — capture what a non-setup-token machine can prove

Only for the two rows in Step 1 that send you here (`"no_key"` and
`"not_linked"`). Run EXACTLY this command, adding only the same `--account <key>`
when it was selected for Step 1:

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/billing-capture.mjs --from-claude --via refresh`

The script asks Claude Code itself for the non-secret subscription info
(`claude auth status`) and reads the non-secret account metadata from
`~/.claude.json` (never any token, never the credentials file), then stores the
plan. Report its one-line output verbatim.

If it says nothing was captured, tell the user their Claude subscription info was
not found. If the output says the self-reported plan was kept, report that
verbatim. If the output contains `gateway=custom`, tell the user this machine goes
through a custom API endpoint, so only they can say what it bills — point them at
`/beezi:login`, which asks.

Account selection: use the default Beezi account (the `default=yes` line) unless the user names
another; for another, add `--account <key>` to every key-resolve and billing-capture command in
this flow.

## Crash reports & status line

First run EXACTLY and write its output verbatim as your reply text (the current settings, before
anything else):

`node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/settings.mjs privacy`

With a mode in the arguments, run it without asking, then write its output verbatim and stop:

- `telemetry on`, `telemetry off`, `telemetry correlate` or `telemetry anonymous` →
  `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/telemetry.mjs <mode>`
- `statusline on` → `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/statusline-install.mjs`
- `statusline off` → `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/statusline-install.mjs --uninstall`

Otherwise make ONE AskUserQuestion call with two questions:

1. (with previews: the `settings.mjs privacy` output) "How should Beezi crash reports work?" with the options "Correlate (recommended)" (description
   "Crash reports with an installation ID, so support can find yours"), "On" ("Crash reports
   without an installation ID"), "Off" ("No crash reports; pending ones are deleted") and
   "Anonymous" ("Stay on, and delete the installation ID and the reports that carry it").
2. "Should Beezi's status line record your live plan usage?" with the options "On" (description
   "Records the usage numbers Claude Code already computes for the status line; your status line
   looks the same") and "Off" ("Usage is still read from Claude Code's cache, less often").

Add ", current setting" to the description of the option matching `crash=` (`correlate`, `on`,
`off`, `anonymous`) and of the one matching `statusline=` (`on`, `off`).

Then run only what changed:

- A crash-report answer other than the current one → run EXACTLY
  `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/telemetry.mjs <correlate|on|off|anonymous>`
- A status-line answer other than the current one → run EXACTLY
  `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/statusline-install.mjs` for "On", or
  `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/statusline-install.mjs --uninstall` for "Off".

Write each output verbatim. When nothing changed, say the settings are unchanged.

If the user asks what crash reports collect: plugin and Claude Code versions, OS, and which plugin
file failed — never their code, prompts, file paths, or repository names. `correlate` is the
recommended way to turn them on; never talk the user out of `on` or `off`.

Every output you show is written verbatim.
