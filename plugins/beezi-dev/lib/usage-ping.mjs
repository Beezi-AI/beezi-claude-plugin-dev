// Standalone capture of the subscription-limit cache, decoupled from runCheckpoint.
//
// Why it exists: the snapshot post used to ride only inside runCheckpoint, which runs at turn end,
// session end, and git Bash commands. Claude Code refreshes `cachedUsageUtilization` on its own
// schedule, so any refresh landing mid-turn — during a long agent run, or between a compaction and
// the next Stop — was simply never observed. Missed observations bias the exhausted-window counts
// DOWNWARD, which is the wrong direction for a check that recommends buying a bigger plan.
//
// This does NOT make the data fresher. Freshness is capped by Claude Code's own refresh schedule;
// we only widen how many of its distinct refreshes we actually see.
//
// Cost discipline: this runs on every prompt. `~/.claude.json` is routinely megabytes, so parsing
// it per prompt is not acceptable. The mtime gate below turns the common case into a single stat()
// — no parse, no token load, no network.
