// Leaf module — imports nothing. The identity axis of CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN.
//
// A machine exporting a fingerprintable setup token identifies BY THAT TOKEN ALONE: the check-in
// sends no accountUuid and no email, and each session report sends no account_uuid and no
// account_email. Only the fingerprint travels — in the check-in's `keys` array (kind
// `claude_oauth_token`) and as the report's oauth_key_prefix/last4/length.
//
// Why the other two are withheld rather than sent alongside: a setup token is the auth method of
// CI runners and re-provisioned boxes, and on exactly those machines ~/.claude.json's oauthAccount
// and `claude auth status --json` describe whatever login last touched the disk. Both are also
// blind to a token rotation. Both are matched BEFORE the fingerprint server-side, so sending a
// stale identity next to a live fingerprint does not add a second opinion — the stale one wins.
//
// What the server does with a fingerprint-only check-in: it does NOT resolve the fingerprint to an
// account — a fingerprint is low-entropy and unverifiable, so it is never treated as an identity
// claim. With no accountUuid and no email in the payload there is nothing for it to resolve FROM,
// so it binds the credential to whatever account that credential row already points at, and MINTS
// an anonymous one when it points at nothing.
//
// The danger is therefore the check-in that is NOT fingerprint-only. Send a uuid or an email
// alongside — which happens whenever the token is invisible to this plugin, since the suppression
// below is what withholds them — and the server resolves that identity to an account and fills the
// credential's binding with it. Bindings are filled but never moved, so a key bound that way to the
// wrong person's account stays there. That is not a hypothetical; it is why the suppression exists.
//
// Consequences worth knowing here:
//   - Rotating the token mints a new credential and therefore a new account row. Only a later
//     check-in that reports a real accountUuid alongside the same fingerprint merges them.
//   - A user who belongs to several vendor accounts gets the most recently active one. There is no
//     client-side signal that could do better: the usage cache's own accountUuid comes from the
//     same stale file.
//
// SERVER FLOOR: this requires the API's Case C, the credential-anchored account
// (CliAgentCredentialRepository.ensureAccountForOauthCredential, migration 1787850000000) and the
// tiered credential binding in upsertCredential. Against an older API a fingerprint-only check-in
// resolves no account at all and every session lands in the analytics IS NULL bucket. Do not
// publish a plugin version carrying this suppression before that API is live in prod.
//
// Rotation is an account switch on the client for the same reason it matters on the server: the
// fingerprint is the only local signal that moves when the token does.

// Below this length a prefix+suffix pair leaves too little hidden to be safe: at 20 characters the
// 12+4 window still conceals at least 4, which is also exactly what makes the server keep the entry
// (it drops anything where prefix.length + last4.length >= length). Real credentials are far longer;
// anything shorter is a placeholder, an empty export, or a truncated value — nothing worth a row.
const MIN_FINGERPRINTABLE_LENGTH = 20;

// The one predicate the suppression sites share, so they cannot drift. Truthiness is NOT enough:
// `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=x` identifies nothing, the server would drop the key entry, and
// suppressing on it would trade a usable identity for none at all.

// that happened to reuse the last4 would still be a different credential row — and a client that
// saw no change would never re-capture the plan for it.
